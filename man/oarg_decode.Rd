\title{Decode and store records from OpenAIRE Research Graph files}
\usage{
oarg_decode(oaire = NULL, limit = NULL, records_path = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{oaire}{compressed json file}

\item{limit}{number of records to be decoded}

\item{records_path}{directory for the xml files}

\item{verbose}{print some information on what is going on}
}
\value{
Exports de-compressed XML-formatted record, storing them locally
 as zip files. The file name represents the record identifier.
}
\description{
OpenAIRE Research Graph files are json-files that contain a record identifier
and a BASE64 encoded text string representing the metadata. This function
decodes these strings and saves them locally.
}
\details{
De-coding and storing the records individually from an OpenAIRE Research Graph
dump allows to process the records independent from each other, which is a
common approach when working with big data.

Because the dumps are quite large, the function furthermore has a
parameter that allows setting a limit, which is helpful for inspecting
the output first.

 By default, a progress bar presents the current state of the process.

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(jsonlite)
dump_file <- system.file("extdata", "", package = "openairegraph")
# a dump file is in json format
loaded_dump <- jsonlite::stream_in(file("dump_file"))
# writes out each XML-formatted record as a zip file to a specified folder
oaire_decode(loaded_dump, limit = 10, records_path = "data/")
}
